    <p><img src ="gambar/kawan_1.jpeg"alt =" friend UITM" style="width:300px; height: 400px;float: left;border: 8px double;"target="_blank"title="Friend UiTM"><p style="font-size: 30px;"><mark>My diploma</mark> period at <b>UiTM</b> was one of the most meaningful moments in my life. That's where I met my  friends — <i>Fatin, Mekwa and Reen</i>. We started to get close since orientation week. At that time, we were all still awkward and shy. But, because we sat in the next room and always hung out together during meals, our friendship quickly developed.One of the memories I remember the most is when we all struggled to complete last-minute assignments. At 3 am, we were still sitting in front of our laptops at the study table, eating Maggi and laughing out loud when one of us typed incorrectly or fell asleep on the keyboard.Reen was always the most enthusiastic person in the group — she was the leader when giving presentations. Mekwa was the quiet type but had many brilliant ideas. Fatin? The happy-go-lucky one who always made the atmosphere cheerful.Even though we have each gone our own way now, I still cherish every memory from my diploma period. Friends like them are not easy to meet — they are not just classmates, but family abroad.</p></p>

    <p><img src ="gambar/kawan_2.jpeg"alt =" friend UITM" style="width:450px; height: 300px;float: right;border: 6px dotted;"target="_blank"title="Best Group Forever"><p style="font-size: 30px;">Throughout the five semesters of my diploma studies at <b>UiTM</b>, various group assignments were carried out which provided valuable learning experiences. Among all, there was one group assignment that stood out the most and had a great impact in terms of learning, collaboration, and work results. This assignment not only tested understanding of the subject, but also honed the communication, time management, and creativity skills of the group members. The unity of ideas and responsibilities shouldered together made this assignment a sweet memory and a proud achievement. Through this experience, we learned that the success of a project does not only depend on individual knowledge, but also the spirit of cooperation and commitment of each group member. This assignment became a symbol of the strength of the team and the results of hard work throughout our studies.</p></p>
